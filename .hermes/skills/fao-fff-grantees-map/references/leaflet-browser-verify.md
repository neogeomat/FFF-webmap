# Verifying Leaflet / qgis2web map changes in a browser

The user requires proof a UI change actually renders — "done" without browser verification is rejected.

## Serve (required for fetch-loaded layers)
    python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory Webmap
    # open http://localhost:8000
Boundary overlays load via `fetch` and are BLOCKED on `file://` — always use HTTP to verify them.

## Browser-console checks
- Layout fill: `card.getBoundingClientRect().width / panel.getBoundingClientRect().width`
  (a small residual inset from `.card-body` padding is normal; aim for ~full width).
- Overlay rendered? Count SVG paths in the layer's pane:
    document.querySelector('.leaflet-pane_<Name>-pane').querySelectorAll('path').length
  PANE CLASS IS `leaflet-pane_<Name>-pane` — Leaflet appends `-pane`. Using `.pane_<Name>`
  returns null/0 and gives a false "nothing rendered" reading.
  Expected path counts: District=77, Province=7, Chure=1, Nepal=1. District/Province
  start OFF — toggle their `#granteeFilterBar` checkboxes before counting; Chure and Nepal start ON.
- Toggle a layer-control checkbox (or a `#granteeFilterBar` pill), then re-measure to confirm it draws.
- Chure, Nepal (country), and the Organizations (grantee markers) cluster layer are ON by default.

## Gotcha: OpenCode delegation
After `opencode run`, the edit may have landed even if the command exits non-zero from trailing
shell noise (`-/ command not found`, `unexpected EOF`). Verify with `git diff --stat` and a
`node --check` on the relevant `<script>` block rather than trusting the exit code.

## Verifying the async Grantees layer (added with Leaflet-ajax)
The grantee layer is built inside `layer_Grantees.on('data:loaded', ...)`, so `window.layer_Grantees`
is NOT defined (it's closure-scoped). Probe the rendered result instead:
- Marker clusters: `document.querySelectorAll('.grantee-cluster').length`
- Sum of points: read each `.grantee-cluster` text label (the child count) and add them; at the
  default Nepal zoom most/all points are clustered. The Type-of-Grant pills give the definitive
  total: `DBG (11)` + `LoA (28)` = 39 Point features (matches the expected count).
- Filter pills: `#granteeFilterBar .gf-type` (expect 2: DBG, LoA) with their counts in the label.
- Left DataTable: `#dataTable tbody tr` (first page is paginated, ~10 rows; not the full count).
A successful render = clusters > 0 AND 2 filter pills AND table rows > 0 AND no JS console errors.
If clusters = 0 but pills/table are also empty, the `data:loaded` callback didn't fire — check the
geojson URL (must be `data/Grantees.geojson`, HTTP-served) and that `leaflet-ajax.min.js` loaded.

Features with `geometry: null` are skipped by Leaflet, so counts reflect only the Point features.

## Browser sandbox workaround (this Ubuntu host)
The Hermes `browser_exec` harness launches Chrome itself and relies on user namespaces, which this
kernel blocks (`Sandbox: CanCreateUserNamespace() unshare(CLONE_NEWPID): EPERM`) — so the harness
fails to start Chrome and no popup appears. Workaround that worked: pre-launch Playwright's Chromium
with `--no-sandbox` + a DevTools port, then run `browser_exec` (the harness attaches to the
already-running browser instead of launching its own):
    CHROME=~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-*/chrome-linux64/chrome
    "$CHROME" --headless=new --no-sandbox --disable-gpu --disable-dev-shm-usage \
      --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-hermes about:blank >/tmp/chrome-dbg.log 2>&1 &
    sleep 3; curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version   # confirm "DevTools listening"
Then `python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory Webmap` and drive `http://localhost:8000`.
Firefox/Zen are NOT usable with this harness — it is CDP/Chrome-only.
